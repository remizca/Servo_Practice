For this project, involving sound detection, servo motors, and an OLED display, the following wiring instructions will guide you through the setup. You'll need to connect the Arduino Uno to a sound sensor, two servo motors, and a 0.96-inch OLED display.

Components Needed:
Arduino Uno R3
Sound Sensor (e.g., KY-037 or any analog sound sensor)
Two Servo Motors (e.g., SG90 or MG996R)
0.96-inch OLED Display (SSD1306, I2C)
Breadboard and Jumper Wires
Pin Connections:
1. Sound Sensor:
VCC (power) → 5V on Arduino.
GND (ground) → GND on Arduino.
OUT (analog output) → A0 on Arduino (to detect sound level).
2. Servo Motors:
Horizontal Servo (attached to Pin 9 on Arduino):
VCC (power) → 5V on Arduino (or external power supply if using larger servos).
GND → GND on Arduino.
Signal (control) → Pin 9 on Arduino.
Vertical Servo (attached to Pin 10 on Arduino):
VCC (power) → 5V on Arduino (or external power supply).
GND → GND on Arduino.
Signal (control) → Pin 10 on Arduino.
Note: If using high-torque servos, consider using an external power supply for the servos to avoid drawing too much current from the Arduino.

3. OLED Display (I2C):
VCC (power) → 3.3V on Arduino.
GND → GND on Arduino.
SCL (I2C Clock) → A5 on Arduino.
SDA (I2C Data) → A4 on Arduino.

Power Considerations:
You can power both the OLED display and the servos using the 5V and GND pins on the Arduino, but for larger servos, it’s better to use an external power supply.
Make sure all the components share a common ground (GND).
Visual Wiring Overview:
Sound Sensor: Connects to A0 for sound detection.
Servos: Connect to Pin 9 and Pin 10 for control (PWM signals).
OLED Display: Uses I2C protocol, connected to A4 (SDA) and A5 (SCL) on the Arduino.
